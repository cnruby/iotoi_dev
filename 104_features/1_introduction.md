## Features
`simpler-paper` contains a lot of conventions,
and in some cases you need only a few simple steps to achieve more customizing effects.


Of course, you don't need them and you can make a good document,
these simple features can help you reduce the annoyance of editing documents and focus on the content of the document,
that's our purpose too.

The features include the following parts:

- [Assets File](#/features/assets.md)
- [Grammar](#/features/grammar.md)
- [Menus](#/features/menus.md)
